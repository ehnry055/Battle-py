        This method creates all of the widgets character selector page.
        The information about each character should be derived from self.roster, 
        which is a CharacterRoster loaded from battle_characters.txt. 
        The layout should NOT be hard-coded: if you re-order, alter, or remove entries 
        in battle_characters.txt, the layout should automatically reflect those changes. 
        
        ########
        
        The radio buttons on this page should all use the variable "self.character_index_index".  
        The values of the radio buttons must be a number equally the position of the character in the list. 
        For example, if the characters listed are Troll, Elf, Human, and Dwarf.  self.character_index would equal 0 
        for the Troll, 1 for the Elf, and so forth.  
        
        The variable self.character_index has been instantiated for your convenience below.

            w.grid (ADD PARAMETERS HERE)
        '''
        self.character_index = StringVar()
        self.character_index.set(None)

        Label(self, text = "Hit Points\tDexterity\tStrength").grid(row = 0, column = 2, sticky = E)

        for i in range(self.roster.get_number_of_characters()):
            Radiobutton(self, text = self.roster.character_list[i].name, variable = self.character_index, value = i).grid(row = 2 + i, column = 0, sticky = W)
